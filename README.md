<h1>Landing Page Project</h1>
This Is my first project as a fron end devoloper .. 
Udacity gave me the starter code and I completed Java script code and added dynamicity to the code  and added responsive navigation bar 
I tried to make the site real project for a real reuseme of mine so I edited HTML and added  my own sections.
Basicly I Just added Few lines of code to CSS starter code. 

Most of work was on java script.

and here is a good place to thank https://github.com/aladdinhub for her vedios in which she explained the logic she used which i loved it and written my code on the same logic 

finally I edited the nav bar to  be humberger menu in phones and tablet .
